	<p class="intro">I am a web-loving software engineer currently working at <a href="https://www.zuehlke.com/de/en/">Zuehlke Engineering</a> in Germany.
	After studying Computer Science and Media i am now doing primarily web related stuff and developing single page applications.
	When i have the time i like to try out new promising technologies and keep on track with the fast moving and exciting web.</p>

	<p class="intro">This is where i want to blog about my experiences, problem solutions and other cool things i mainly faced in my projects.
	<br />
	Currently i am working on a large project where we are using <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia</a> *still celebrating :D* so many posts will be Aurelia related.
