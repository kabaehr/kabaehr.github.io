	<h1 class="pageTitle">This is me </h1>
		

	<p class="intro">I am a web-loving software engineer currently working at <a href="https://www.zuehlke.com/de/en/">Zuehlke Engineering</a> in Germany.
	After studying Computer Science and Media I am now doing primarily web related stuff and developing single page applications.
	When I have the time I like to try out new promising technologies and keep on track with the fast moving and exciting web.</p>

	<p class="intro">This is where I want to blog about my experiences, problem solutions and other cool things I mainly faced in my projects. <sub>Opinions are my own, not my company ones.</sub>
